Idea: Create an inventory system following a course that relates to a 2D game (which, for now is similar to what we want for the main game, starting) that is similar to what we want. 

- RPG (at this point) has the following:
    - Spell casting
    - Animations
    - Health & Mana Bars
    - Enemies
    - Worldmap
    - Tilemap
    - Keybinds
    - Spellbook

I think this is really useful because this course shows off other things that we'll be finding useful (like loot, tooltips, gear, quests, xp, saving, crafting) with a consistent scripting approach (by Inscope.me) for 2D Games. We can acquire assets [Monster Hunter Assets](https://www.notion.so/Monster-Hunter-Assets-719e1eafc6bf429287052971a9abda9a) later on. 

Idea for building: People add tilemaps as mods for their bases, which then have storage (integration with player inventory) and their paintings, connected to ship). Think of sandbox style of Monster Sanctuary with similar UI to Crashlands/NMS/Minecraft. Building/construction/electronics can still be done, but that will maybe be limited to a crafting tree, and puzzles:

- Players can acquire items, craft them together and finish puzzles
- Those would then power certain things, for example the inventory multitool
- Other building things

Could we have automatic building (like in quests in Crashlands?)
